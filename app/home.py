    This advanced intrusion detection system leverages Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) to generate various synthetic IoT attack dataset and implements a lightGBM multi-class classification model to detect the type of intrusion. The CGAN model was trained RT-IOT2022 data that can be found here:
