# AI-Driven Cybersecurity

In the realm of cybersecurity, the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices coupled with sophisticated network attack methodologies presents an ongoing challenge for defenders. To address this challenge, this project proposes the development and implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for multi-class classification. Leveraging the RT-IoT2022 dataset, which encapsulates diverse IoT devices and attack scenarios, the proposed IDS aims to achieve a micro-averaged F1 score of at least 95% in discerning between nine types of attack patterns and three types of normal patterns. The project objectives encompass the development of a robust GAN architecture, mitigation of GAN-specific challenges, and seamless integration with existing security infrastructures. The methodology entails a comprehensive data analytics workflow, encompassing data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, GAN model design, training, evaluation, and refinement, culminating in integration and testing in simulated environments. The significance of this research lies in its potential to address the evolving cyber threats efficiently, thereby enhancing cybersecurity measures, protecting personal data, and mitigating financial losses for businesses. Moreover, it contributes to the advancement of AI in practical applications, particularly in the cybersecurity domain, paving the way for future developments in defensive mechanisms against cyberattacks.
